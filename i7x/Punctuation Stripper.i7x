Version 1/200614 of Punctuation Stripper by Andrew Schultz begins here.

"I took the highest-priority bits from Emily Short's Punctuation Removal for this. When including this, I probably want to insert the punctuation-munge rule from here where appropriate in after reading the player's command."

to decide whether is-comment: (- isComment() -)

to parse-continue: (- ParsePunc(); -)

after reading a command (this is the punctuation-munge rule):
	if is-comment, reject the player's command;
	parse-continue;

Punctuation Stripper ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

We shouldn't have to do more than include Punctuation Stripper to get it to run. However, it can be modified if we don't want to eliminate some punctuation.

The main tweaks to the code are in this rule. If all booleans were switched, this extension would have no effect. The most likely one to switch is remove-commas, so you can use "PERSON, COMMAND" if wanted.

Note that commas and hyphens are replaced with spaces, but apostrophes are removed completely. This isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, but it seems the most likely to be what the player intended.

	when play begins:
		now remove-commas is false;
		now remove-dashes is false;
		now remove-apostrophes is false;

You also may wish to add this line in case rules conflict:

	the punctuation-munge rule is listed first in the after reading a command rule.
